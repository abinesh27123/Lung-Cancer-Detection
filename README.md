# Lung Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assist in the early detection of lung cancer. Utilizing various supervised learning algorithms, we analyze medical imaging data to classify images as either cancerous or non-cancerous. Early detection of lung cancer can significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.
